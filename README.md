# Pongduino

Pong playable with a controller built on the Arduino.
After the failure of my Tetris attempt in C, I'm trying to learn C++ by building Pong. I would also like to build a controller with the Arduino and communicate through the serial port.
Also, if I have time/interest it would be cool to try and build a UDP server to play two player on different instances of the game.

## Plan

- ## Create the gamearea class
- Create the Pong class
  -- Will be the overarching class which encapsulates everything
- Create a controller adapter
- Create a paddle class
- Create a ball class
- Create a score class
